In my view, great products find alignment between technical feasibility, human needs and viability for the organisation, and this is the intersection I am interested in pursuing. </p><p> Previously I&#39;ve worked as a graphic designer to deliver quality assets for Wisr and also worked at NSW Health to deliver health resources for young people as well as facilitated focus groups and webinars for health organisations. </p><p> Outside of this, I&#39;m passionate about food, cooking and exploring a city&#39;s restaurant scene and love indie video games and 80&#39;s horror movies. </p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/indi-sofyar/"><button class="button mt-4">View <i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin"></i> LinkedIn for work experience</button></a></div></div>',1),r=[o];function t(e,i){return(0,s.wg)(),(0,s.iD)("section",n,r)}var l=a(89);const d={},c=(0,l.Z)(d,[["render",t]]);var u=c}}]);
